abstract = {Abstract In this paper, we survey the most recent advances in supervised machine learning (ML) and high-dimensional models for time-series forecasting. We consider both linear and nonlinear alternatives. Among the linear methods, we pay special attention to penalized regressions and ensemble of models. The nonlinear methods considered in the paper include shallow and deep neural networks, in their feedforward and recurrent versions, and tree-based methods, such as random forests and boosted trees. We also consider ensemble and hybrid models by combining ingredients from different alternatives. Tests for superior predictive ability are briefly reviewed. Finally, we discuss application of ML in economics and finance and provide an illustration with high-frequency financial data.}

abstract = {We show that high-dimensional econometric models, such as shrinkage and complete subset regression, perform very well in the real-time forecasting of inflation in data-rich environments. We use Brazilian inflation as an application. It is ideal as an example because it exhibits a high short-term volatility, and several agents devote extensive resources to forecasting its short-term behavior. Thus, precise forecasts made by specialists are available both as a benchmark and as an important candidate regressor for the forecasting models. Furthermore, we combine forecasts based on model confidence sets and show that model combination can achieve superior predictive performances.}

  abstract={In this paper we use high-dimensional models, estimated by the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), to forecast the Brazilian inflation. The models are compared to benchmark specifications such as linear autoregressive (AR) and the factor models based on principal components. Our results showed that the LASSO-based specifications have the smallest errors for short-horizon forecasts. However, for long horizons the AR benchmark is the best model with respect to point forecasts. The factor model also produces some good long horizon forecasts in a few cases. We estimated all the models for the two most important Brazilian inflation measures, the IPCA and the IGP-M indexes. The results also showed that there are differences on the selected variables for both measures. Finally, the most important variables selected by the LASSO based models are, in general, related to government debt and money. On the other hand, variables such as unemployment and production were rarely selected by the LASSO.},

  abstract={Many applied settings in empirical economics involve simultaneous estimation of a large number of parameters. In particular, applied economists are often interested in estimating the effects of many-valued treatments (like teacher effects or location effects), treatment effects for many groups, and prediction models with many regressors. In these settings, machine learning methods that combine regularized estimation and data-driven choices of regularization parameters are useful to avoid over-fitting. In this article, we analyze the performance of a class of such methods that includes ridge, lasso, and pretest, in contexts that require simultaneous estimation of many parameters. Our analysis aims to provide guidance to applied researchers on (i) the choice between regularized estimators in practice and (ii) data-driven selection of regularization parameters. To address (i), we characterize the risk (mean squared error) of regularized estimators and derive their relative performance as a function of simple features of the data generating process. To address (ii), we show that data-driven choices of regularization parameters, based on Stein's unbiased risk estimate or on cross-validation, yield estimators with risk uniformly close to the risk attained under the optimal (unfeasible) choice of regularization parameters. We use data from recent examples in the empirical economics literature to illustrate the practical applicability of our results.},

In fact, these are the winning methods in many cases. A second contribution of this work is the construction of a large dataset with macroeconomic variables related to the Chilean economy similar to McCracken and Ng (2016), who built (and maintains) a similar data for the United States.},

  abstract={We contribute to recent research on the optimality of macroeconomic forecasts. We start from the assumption that forecasters may have a flexible rather than a symmetric (quadratic) loss function assumed in standard tests. This assumption leads to the prediction that variables available to a forecaster when a forecast was formed should have no predictive value for a binary 0/1-indicator that captures the sign of the forecast error. A test of forecast optimality, thus, can be interpreted as a classification problem. We use random forests to model this classification problem. Random forests are a powerful nonparametric modeling instrument originally developed in the machine-learning literature. Unlike conventional linear-probability or logit/probit-models, random forests account in a natural way for potential nonlinear links between the signed forecast error and the variables in a forecaster's information set. Random forests also can handle a situation in which the number of forecasts is small relative to the number of predictor variables that a researcher uses to proxy a forecaster's information set. Random forests, therefore, are a powerful modeling device that is of interest for every researcher who studies the properties of macroeconomic forecasts. Upon estimating random forests on forecasts of four German research institutes, we document that optimality of longer-term inflation forecasts cannot be rejected and that inflation forecasts are weakly efficient. For shorter-term inflation forecasts, our results are heterogeneous across research institutes. When we pool the data across the research institutes, we reject optimality of both shorter-term and longer-term forecasts.},
